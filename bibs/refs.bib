abstract = {The growing popularity of Android applications has generated increased concerns over the danger of piracy and the spread of malware, and particularly of adware: malware that seeks to present unwanted advertisements to the user. A popular way to distribute malware in the mobile world is through repackaging of legitimate apps. This process consists of downloading, unpacking, manipulating, recompiling an application, and publishing it again in an app store. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of over 15,000 apps to gain insights into the factors that drive the spread of repackaged apps. We also examine the motivations of developers who publish repackaged apps and those of users who download them, as well as the factors that determine which apps are chosen for repackaging, and the ways in which the apps are modified during the repackaging process. Having observed that adware is particularly prevalent in repackaged apps, we focus on this type of malware and examine how the app is modified when it is injected in an app's code. Our findings shed much needed light on this class of malware that can be useful to security experts, and allow us to make recommendations that could lead to the creation of more effective malware detection tools, Furthermore, on the basis of our results, we propose a novel app indexing scheme that minimizes the number of comparisons needed to detect repackaged apps.},

@article{Vidas2013,
abstract = {Application marketplaces are the main software distribution mechanism for modern mobile devices but are also emerging as a viable alternative to brick-and-mortar stores for personal computers. While most application marketplaces require applications to be cryptographically signed by their developers, in Android marketplaces, self-signed certificates are common, thereby offering very limited authentication properties. As a result, there have been reports of malware being distributed through application "repackaging." We provide a quantitative assessment of this phenomenon by collecting 41,057 applications from 194 alternative Android application markets in October 2011, in addition to a sample of 35,423 applications from the official Android market, Google Play. We observe that certain alternative markets almost exclusively distribute repackaged applications containing malware. To remedy this situation we propose a simple verification protocol, and discuss a proofof- concept implementation, AppIntegrity. AppIntegrity strengthens the authentication properties offered in application marketplaces, thereby making it more difficult for miscreants to repackage apps, while presenting very little computational or communication overhead, and being deployable without requiring significant changes to the Android platform.

@article{wu2012,
abstract = {Recently, the threat of Android malware is spreading rapidly, especially those repackaged Android malware. Although understanding Android malware using dynamic analysis can provide a comprehensive view, it is still subjected to high cost in environment deployment and manual efforts in investigation. In this study, we propose a static feature-based mechanism to provide a static analyst paradigm for detecting the Android malware. The mechanism considers the static information including permissions, deployment of components, Intent messages passing and API calls for characterizing the Android applications behavior. In order to recognize different intentions of Android malware, different kinds of clustering algorithms can be applied to enhance the malware modeling capability. Besides, we leverage the proposed mechanism and develop a system, called Droid Mat. First, the Droid Mat extracts the information (e.g., requested permissions, Intent messages passing, etc) from each application's manifest file, and regards components (Activity, Service, Receiver) as entry points drilling down for tracing API Calls related to permissions. Next, it applies K-means algorithm that enhances the malware modeling capability. The number of clusters are decided by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) method on the low rank approximation. Finally, it uses kNN algorithm to classify the application as benign or malicious. The experiment result shows that the recall rate of our approach is better than one of well-known tool, Androguard, published in Black hat 2011, which focuses on Android malware analysis. In addition, Droid Mat is efficient since it takes only half of time than Androguard to predict 1738 apps as benign apps or Android malware. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Machine learning-based solutions have been successfully employed for the automatic detection of malware on Android. However, machine learning models lack robustness to adversarial examples, which are crafted by adding carefully chosen perturbations to the normal inputs. So far, the adversarial examples can only deceive detectors that rely on syntactic features (e.g., requested permissions, API calls, etc.), and the perturbations can only be implemented by simply modifying application's manifest. While recent Android malware detectors rely more on semantic features from Dalvik bytecode rather than manifest, existing attacking/defending methods are no longer effective. In this paper, we introduce a new attacking method that generates adversarial examples of Android malware and evades being detected by the current models. To this end, we propose a method of applying optimal perturbations onto Android APK that can successfully deceive the machine learning detectors. We develop an automated tool to generate the adversarial examples without human intervention. In contrast to existing works, the adversarial examples crafted by our method can also deceive recent machine learning-based detectors that rely on semantic features such as control-flow-graph. The perturbations can also be implemented directly onto APK's Dalvik bytecode rather than Android manifest to evade from recent detectors. We demonstrate our attack on two state-of-the-art Android malware detection schemes, MaMaDroid and Drebin. Our results show that the malware detection rates decreased from 96% to 0% in MaMaDroid, and from 97% to 0% in Drebin, with just a small number of codes to be inserted into the APK.},

DNADroid has a very low false positive rate - we manually confirmed that all the applications detected are indeed clones by either visual or behavioral similarity. We present several case studies that give insight into why applications are cloned, including localization and redirecting ad revenue. We describe a case of malware being added to an application and show how DNADroid was able to detect two variants of the same malware.

@book{Dong2018,
abstract = {Program code is a valuable asset to its owner. Due to the easy-to-reverse nature of Java, code protection for Android apps is of particular importance. To this end, code obfuscation is widely utilized by both legitimate app developers and malware authors, which complicates the representation of source code or machine code in order to hinder the manual investigation and code analysis. Despite many previous studies focusing on the obfuscation techniques, however, our knowledge of how obfuscation is applied by real-world developers is still limited. In this paper, we seek to better understand Android obfuscation and depict a holistic view of the usage of obfuscation through a large-scale investigation in the wild. In particular, we focus on three popular obfuscation approaches: identifier renaming, string encryption and Java reflection. To obtain the meaningful statistical results, we designed efficient and lightweight detection models for each obfuscation technique and applied them to our massive APK datasets (collected from Google Play, multiple third-party markets, and malware databases). We have learned several interesting facts from the result. For example, more apps on third-party markets than malware use identifier renaming, and malware authors use string encryption more frequently. We are also interested in the explanation of each finding. Therefore we carry out in-depth code analysis on some Android apps after sampling. We believe our study will help developers select the most suitable obfuscation approach, and in the meantime help researchers improve code analysis systems in the right direction.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of detecting plagiarized mobile apps. Plagiarism is the practice of building mobile apps by reusing code from other apps without the consent of the corresponding app developers. Recent studies on third-party app markets have suggested that plagiarized apps are an important vehicle for malware delivery on mobile phones. Malware authors repackage official versions of apps with malicious functionality, and distribute them for free via these third-party app markets. An effective technique to detect app plagiarism can therefore help identify malicious apps. Code plagiarism has long been a problem and a number of code similarity detectors have been developed over the years to detect plagiarism. In this paper we show that obfuscation techniques can be used to easily defeat similarity detectors that rely solely on statically scanning the code of an app. We propose a dynamic technique to detect plagiarized apps that works by observing the interaction of an app with the underlying mobile platform via its API invocations. We propose API birthmarks to characterize unique app behaviors, and develop a robust plagiarism detection tool using API birthmarks.},

abstract = {Android security has become highly desirable since adversaries can easily repackage malicious codes into various benign applications and spread these malicious repackaged applications (MRAs). Most MRA detection mechanisms on Android focus on detecting a specific family of MRAs or requiring the original benign application to compare with the malicious ones. This work proposes a new mechanism, SCSdroid (System Call Sequence Droid), which adopts the thread-grained system call sequences activated by applications. The concept is that even if MRAs can be camouflaged as benign applications, their malicious behavior would still appear in the system call sequences. SCSdroid extracts the truly malicious common subsequences from the system call sequences of MRAs belonging to the same family. Therefore, these extracted common subsequences can be used to identify any evaluated application without requiring the original benign application. Experimental results show that SCSdroid falsely detected only two applications among 100 evaluated benign applications, and falsely detected only one application among 49 evaluated malicious applications. As a result, SCSdroid achieved up to 95.97% detection accuracy, i.e., 143 correct detections among 149 applications. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Digital forensics is a branch of Computer Science aiming at investigating and analyzing electronic devices in the search for crime evidence. There are several ways to perform this search. Known File Filter (KFF) is one of them, where a list of interest objects is used to reduce/separate data for analysis. Holding a database of hashes of such objects, the examiner performs lookups for matches against the target device. However, due to limitations over hash functions (inability to detect similar objects), newmethods have been designed, called approximate matching. This sort of function has interesting characteristics for KFF investigations but suffers mainly from high costs when dealing with huge data sets, as the search is usually done by brute force. To mitigate this problem, strategies have been developed to better perform lookups. In this paper, we present the state of the art of similarity digest search strategies, along with a detailed comparison involving several aspects, as time complexity, memory requirement, and search precision. Our results show that none of the approaches address at least these main aspects. Finally, we discuss future directions and present requirements for a new strategy aiming to fulfill current limitations.},

abstract = {Repackaged Android applications (or simply apps) are one of the major sources of mobile malware and also an important cause of severe revenue loss to app developers. Although a number of solutions have been proposed to detect repackaged apps, the majority of them heavily rely on code analysis, thus suffering from two limitations: (1) poor scalability due to the billion opcode problem; (2) unreliability to code obfuscation/app hardening techniques. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that exploits core resources, which have close relationships with codes, to detect repackaged apps. More precisely, we define new features for characterizing apps, investigate two kinds of algorithms for searching similar apps, and propose a two-stage methodology to speed up the detection. We realize our approach in a system named ResDroid and conduct large scale evaluation on it. The results show that ResDroid can identify repackaged apps efficiently and effectively even if they are protected by obfuscation or hardening systems.},

@article{Zhou2012,
abstract = {Recent years have witnessed incredible popularity and adoption of smartphones and mobile devices, which is accompanied by large amount and wide variety of feature-rich smartphone applications. These smartphone applications (or apps), typically organized in different application marketplaces, can be conveniently browsed by mobile users and then simply clicked to install on a variety of mobile devices. In practice, besides the official marketplaces from platform vendors (e.g., Google and Apple), a number of third-party alternative marketplaces have also been created to host thousands of apps (e.g., to meet regional or localization needs). To maintain and foster a hygienic smartphone app ecosystem, there is a need for each third-party marketplace to offer quality apps to mobile users. In this paper, we perform a systematic study on six popular Android-based third-party marketplaces. Among them, we find a common "in-the-wild" practice of repackaging legitimate apps (from the official Android Market) and distributing repackaged ones via third-party marketplaces. To better understand the extent of such practice, we implement an app similarity measurement system called DroidMOSS that applies a fuzzy hashing technique to effectively localize and detect the changes from app-repackaging behavior. The experiments with DroidMOSS show a worrisome fact that 5% to 13% of apps hosted on these studied marketplaces are repackaged. Further manual investigation indicates that these repackaged apps are mainly used to replace existing in-app advertisements or embed new ones to "steal" or re-route ad revenues. We also identify a few cases with planted backdoors or malicious payloads among repackaged apps. The results call for the need of a rigorous vetting process for better regulation of third-party smartphone application marketplaces.},

It is often challenging to stay on top of different types of malware and their detection techniques, which are essential, particularly for researchers and the security community. Analysing malware to get insights into what it intends to perform on the victim’s system is one of the crucial steps towards malware detection. Malware analysis can be performed through static analysis, code analysis, dynamic analysis, memory analysis and hybrid analysis techniques. The next step to malware analysis is the detection model’s design using malware’s extracted patterns from the analysis. Machine learning and deep learning methods have drawn attention to researchers, owing to their ability to implement sophisticated malware detection models that can deal with known and unknown malicious activities. Therefore, this survey presents a comprehensive study and analysis of current malware and detection techniques using the snowball approach. It presents a comprehensive study on malware analysis testbeds, dynamic malware analysis and memory analysis, the taxonomy of malware behaviour analysis tools, datasets repositories, feature selection, machine learning and deep learning techniques. Moreover, comparisons of behaviour-based malware detection techniques have been grouped by categories of machine learning and deep learning techniques. This study also looks at various performance evaluation metrics, current research challenges in this area and possible future direction of research.}

Such an evaluation is important for not only measuring the available defense against mobile malware threats but also proposing effective, next-generation solutions. We developed DroidChameleon, a systematic framework with various transformation techniques, and used it for our study. Our results on ten popular commercial anti-malware applications for Android are worrisome: none of these tools is resistant against common malware transformation techniques.

@article{Ardito2020,
abstract = {Several techniques exist for mobile test automation, from script-based techniques to automated test generation based on GUI models. Most techniques fall short in being adopted extensively by practitioners because of the very costly definition (and maintenance) of test cases. We present a novel testing framework for Android apps that allows a developer to write effective test scripts without having to know the implementation details and the user interface of the app under test. The main goal of the framework is to generate adaptive tests that can be executed on a significant number of apps, or different releases of the same app, without manual editing of the tests. The frameworks consists of: (1) a Test Scripting Language, that allows the tester to write generic test scripts tailored to activity and app categories; (2) a State Graph Modeler, that creates a model of the app's GUI, identifying activities (i.e., screens) and widgets; (3) an app classifier that determines the type of application under test; (4) an activity classifier that determines the purpose of each screen; (5) a test adapter that executes test scripts that are compatible with the specific app and activity, automatically tailoring the test scripts to the classes of the app and the activities under test. We evaluated empirically the components of our testing framework. The classifiers were able to outperform available approaches in the literature. The developed testing frameworkwas able to correctly adapt high-level test cases to 28 out of 32 applications, and to reduce the LOCs of the test scripts of around 90%.We conclude that machine learning can be fruitfully applied to the creation of high-level, adaptive test cases for Android apps. Our framework is modular in nature and allows expansions through the addition of new commands to be executed on the classified apps and activities.},

abstract = {In recent years, as mobile smart device sales grow quickly, the development of mobile applications (apps) keeps accelerating, so does mobile app repackaging. Attackers can easily repackage an app under their own names or embed advertisements to earn pecuniary profits. They can also modify a popular app by inserting malicious payloads into the original app and leverage its popularity to accelerate malware propagation. In this paper, we propose ViewDroid, a user interface based approach to mobile app repackaging detection. Android apps are user interaction intensive and event dominated, and the interactions between users and apps are performed through user interface, or views. This observation inspires the design of our new birthmark for Android apps, namely, feature view graph, which captures users' navigation behavior across app views. Our experimental results demonstrate that this birthmark can characterize Android apps from a higher level abstraction, making it resilient to code obfuscation. ViewDroid can detect repackaged apps at a large scale, both effectively and efficiently. Our experiments also show that the false positive and false negative rates of ViewDroid are both very low.},

Because of the ease of reverse engineering Android applications, repackaged malicious apps that clone existing code have become a severe problem in the marketplace. This research proposes a novel repackaged detection system based on perceptual hashes of vetted Android apps and their associated dynamic user interface (UI) behavior. Results show that an average hash approach produces 88% accuracy (indicating low false negative and false positive rates) in a sample set of 4878 Android apps, including 2151 repackaged apps.

ABSTRACT = {Malware applications (Apps) targeting mobile devices are widespread, and compromise the sensitive and private information stored on the devices. This is due to the asymmetry between informative permissions and irrelevant and redundant permissions for benign Apps. It also depends on the characteristics of the Android platform, such as adopting an open-source policy, supporting unofficial App stores, and the great tolerance for App verification; therefore the Android platform is destined to face such malicious intrusions. In this paper, we propose a permissions-based malware detection system (PerDRaML) that determines the App&rsquo;s maliciousness based on the usage of suspicious permissions. The system uses a multi-level based methodology; we first extract and identify the significant features such as permissions, smali sizes, and permission rates from a manually collected dataset of 10,000 applications. Further, we employ various machine learning models to categorize the Apps into their malicious or benign categories. Through extensive experimentations, the proposed method successfully identifies the 5&times; most significant features to predict malicious Apps. The proposed method outperformed the existing techniques by achieving high accuracies of malware detection i.e., 89.7% with Support Vector Machine, 89.96% with Random Forest, 86.25% with Rotation Forest, and 89.52% with Na&iuml;ve Bayes models. Moreover, the proposed method optimized up to ~77% of the feature set as compared to the recent approaches, while improving the evaluation metrics such as precision, sensitivity, accuracy, and F-measure. The experimental results show that the proposed system provides a high level of symmetry between irrelevant permissions and malware Apps. Further, the proposed system is promising and may provide a low-cost alternative for Android malware detection for malicious or repackaged Apps.},

abstract = {The problem of app repackaging has become a huge threat to the security of Android ecosystem. The massive amount of existing and developing apps makes a high demand on scalability of app repackaging detectors. In this paper, we propose a cloud-based app repackaging detection framework. It is designed to analyze and detect repacked Android apps in a large-scale way. The framework consists of three primary components: market monitor, app feature extractor and app similarity computer. Market monitor crawls all new and updated apps in specific alternative app markets periodically. Then, the multi-level features of apps are extracted by app feature extractor. App similarity computer computes the similarity score of two apps based on these features. A prototype system is implemented. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed cloud-based framework is highly scalable and effective for large-scale Android app repackaging detection.},
